PROBLEM STATEMENT:

    Weather Service Assignment / Project

    Write an http server that uses the Open Weather API that exposes an endpoint that takes in lat/long coordinates. 

    This endpoint should return what the weather condition is outside in that area:
        - (snow, rain, etc)
        - whether itâ€™s hot, cold, or moderate outside (use your own discretion on what temperature equates to each type)
        - whether there are any weather alerts going on in that area, with what is going on if there is currently an active alert. 
        
        
        
    The API can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api. 

    The one-call api returns all of the data while the other apis are piece-mealed sections. You may also find the https://openweathermap.org/faq useful.



RUN INSTRUCTIONS:
    Note you will need to install:
        - node - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
        - angular cli (Only if you want to generate dist files for frontend): npm install -g @angular/cli

    
    - cd into project root directory

    - run: npm install

    - cd into frontend/angular

    - run npm install

    - run npm build

    - cd into project root directory

    - run: node index.js

    - Now you will have a node server listening on port 3000 on localHost

    - Open a browswer and navigate to: http://localhost:3000/api?lat=30.3119&lon=95.4561

    - You will see the raw response for weather data in Conroe, Texas
